#### Passionate software architect, full-stack developer and speaker

> "Statistics only work if the person evaluating them is, on average, more intelligent than chance. - Prof. Dr. Peter Kruse

As Chief Marketing & Technology Officer, I drive [TalentFormation's](https://www.talentformation.com/) approach to business transformation with years of experience in software development, architecture, continuous delivery and cloud. I gained my first professional experience as a software engineer at [OTTO](https://www.otto.de/). From 2017, I was responsible for the entire online shop platform at [Breuninger](https://www.breuninger.com/de/) as Lead Software Architect. In 2020, I took on the role of CIO at [BLUME2000](https://www.blume2000.de/) and was responsible for all employees in the e-commerce IT department. Together with my team, I was responsible for the customer-facing software systems. I am an avid software architect, full-stack developer and speaker with a passion for technology, architecture and organization. I build and operate software in a data-driven manner with a focus on customer value. I also enjoy teaching and training myself and others, and am a founding member of the [Hacker School](https://hacker-school.de/).
